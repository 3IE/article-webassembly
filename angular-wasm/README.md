# AngularWasm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## How to build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Launch the server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Create components

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.


### Note

I added the raws .js and .wasm files in src/app/wasm in case of you were having trouble to compile emsdk by yourself ;-).
